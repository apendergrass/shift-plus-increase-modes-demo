This Matlab demo is meant to walk you through calculating the distribution of 
rain from an input data set of daily rainfall accumulation, as described
in: 

Pendergrass, A.G. and D.L. Hartmann, 2014: Two modes of change of the 
  distribution of rain. Journal of Climate, 27, 8357-8371. 
  doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00182.1.  

and the shift and increase modes of response of the rainfall distribution
to warming, occuring across ENSO events or global warming simulations. 
The response to warming is described in: 

Pendergrass, A.G. and D.L. Hartmann, 2014: Changes in the distribution 
  of rain frequency and intensity in response to global warming. 
  Journal of Climate, 27, 8372-8383. doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00183.1. 

Please cite one or both of these papers if you use or alter these scripts. 

If you have access to the NCAR supercomputer, 
cheyenne https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/cheyenne, the script

raindistdemo_cheyenne.m 

will get you going quickly with CESM large ensemble 
(https://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/models/experiments/LENS) data. 

But if you dont, thats ok, any gridded precipiation dataset will do. 
For example, you can use daily rainfall data from a CMIP5 simulation 
(GFDL-ESM2G is shown below, for the 1pctCO2 scenario)
which you might be able to download, for example from PCMDI 
(https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/cmip5/)

Or you can use data from GPCP 1dd 
https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/gpcp-daily-global-precipitation-climatology-project
or TRMM 3B42
https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/trmm-tropical-rainfall-measuring-mission
though looking at changes in those is different, and you'll have to get
corresponding temperature data somewhere, if you're into that. 

Have fun!
